# Dynamic Discounting and Self-Control: A Simulation of Present Bias and Commitment

## 1) Dynamic inconsistency
Under exponential discounting, relative preferences are time-consistent when both options are shifted forward together.
Under quasi-hyperbolic discounting, \(\beta < 1\) creates present bias: delayed outcomes get an extra short-run penalty, so planned choices can differ from later choices.

## 2) Why preference reversals emerge
Preference reversals occur when LL is chosen at planning (t=0) but SS is chosen later when SS becomes immediate.
This happens because the immediate period receives special weight under β–δ preferences.
In this run (δ=0.995), the highest reversal rate appears around β=0.40 with reversal rate 45.00%.

## 3) Commitment devices
A commitment device forces execution of the initial plan and blocks later switching.
Average realized utility gain from commitment is 7.75, with positive gains in 35.0% of items.
Economically, commitment protects long-run welfare from short-run temptation.
Psychologically, it externalizes self-control.

## 4) Real-world parallels
- Savings and retirement lock-ins.
- Subscription prepayment and cancellation frictions.
- Penalty-backed commitment contracts.
- App blockers or spending controls for digital self-regulation.
